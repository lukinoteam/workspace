Machine Learning
What is it?
    + An application of aritificial of intelligence (AI)
        + what is AI?
            AI is a science to make system intelligent like human.
    + Provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from exp (not programmed)

How it work?
    + First, we need example data (or test data).
    + Then, "system will look" at that data and make decisions in the future based on the example data above.
    + The important thing is the "system will look", this is the primary aim in ML which is to allow systems learn automatically.

ML often categorized as supervised or unsupervised
    + Supervised (have teacher): 
        + Use label. How?
            (label, a.k.a a name of something,... ex: dog, cat, bird,...)
            + First: analize a known training dataset
            (dataset: a set of datas)
            + Then: the system will predict the output
            * The learning algo compare to output with the intended output to find error and modify the model.
    + Unsupervised (no teacher):
        + No classify, no label.
        + The system doesn't figure out the right output, it explore the data and draw inference from dataset to describe hidden structures from data.
